# RISK GLOBAL DOMINATION GAME

## Description
Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players.(in my case 2 players) 
The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of the world, divided into 42 territories (60 in my case), which are grouped into six continents
(4 in my case).
This was my first C++ project , I knew very few things then. If you were to use this code be sure to make changes according to your understanding.

## Game rules
Any person which occupies for territory wins. You can attack other territories or make allies as well.

## Installation
You would need to add OPEN GL's glew and glut library for this project.
Be sure to set up the environment before you run this code.

## Features
Project has 4 continents which are made from rect and triangle functions of opengl.
I had very little knowledge of GUI's back then due to which half of the project is console-based.

## Contributing
I made this solo.
